# Blog project

A simple blog project written in React, using JSON server to store data. 

# Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

# Run JSON Server 
You can input whatever port value you like except 3000, since the application will most likely be running on port 3000.
```bash
npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
```

# Start application

```bash
npm start
```
